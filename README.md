# Chrome Markdown Extension


The goals of this project will be:

1.  Learn how to develop a chrome extension, and
2.  To make a useful, fully functioning markdown-enabled [Google Keep](keep.google.com "Google Keep") tool!


I am starting with Google's [docs and examples](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/overview "Google Docs").
Also, I'll likely be using someone elses auto-markdown "compiler", that work has been done one hundred times before, and I actually want to finish this project :)
